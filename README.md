# Uplift basics

The main purposes of this repo are 
 1. showing how different uplift models work on the basic models where itâ€™s 
possible, 
 2. giving you an instrument which generate synthetic datasets in order to give 
you an opportunity to play with your uplift models


## How to use
1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/MaryRa/uplift-basics.git` <br/>
2. Go through ipynb-files:
   - `1.1.communicate_or_not (binary problem).ipynb` - it shows how to work 
   in situation when we have binary target. For example if there were 
   purchases or not.
   - `1.2.discount_value (regression problem).ipynb` - it shows how to work 
   in situation when we have non-binary target - for example the value of purchases.
   - `2.metrics.ipynb` - it contains some metrics to check quality of your model
